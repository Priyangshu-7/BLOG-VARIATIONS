                    <h1>On the epistemological nature of software interfaces</h1>

                </header>

                <p>An interface is not merely a tool for operation; it is a framework for understanding. When we design
                    a button, we are not just designing a trigger for an event. We are designing a proposition about
                    what is possible in the world of the machine.</p>

                <h2>The Abstraction Layer</h2>
                <p>Consider the file folder. It does not exist. It is a metaphor, a comfortable lie told to us by the
                    operating system to help us map our physical intuition of "containment" onto the scattered bits of a
                    hard drive. This is the primary work of the designer: the construction of useful fictions.</p>

                <hr>

                <h3>Core Principles</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clarity precedes aesthetics.</li>
                    <li>Speed is a feature.</li>
                    <li>Friction is information.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>If we accept this premise, then the "beautification" of software often works against its purpose. By
                    smoothing over the seams of the machine, we obscure its nature. We create a "magic" box that the
                    user cannot reason about, only manipulate.</p>
